# Shaun Joseph Stewart 
### [Project Manager (PMP) | Producer | IT Professional](http://www.linkedin.com/in/shaunjosephstewart)

Customer-centered IT specialist, producer, and PMP with Apple-trained customer care, production-tested project discipline, and hands-on experience supporting endpoints, accounts, and networks, plus a creative portfolio spanning documentaries, online fashion content, e-commerce, and experiential campaigns. 

I‚Äôve contributed to the creative visions and digital operations of HBO, Sotheby‚Äôs, Google, Universal Music Group, Cond√© Nast, Yoox Net-A-Porter Group, Paper Magazine, the Hamptons International Film Festival, and several artists by blending creative strategy, practical IT know-how, and disciplined delivery on fast-moving projects. 

I pair patient front-of-house support with solid planning, clean handoffs, and stakeholder alignment; in technical roles I‚Äôm known for accurate triage, calm troubleshooting, and plain-language updates that keep users and leaders aligned. I document fixes as clear step-by-step procedures to prevent repeat issues and reduce the average time it takes to resolve problems.

I‚Äôm committed to growing and continuously learning through labs, coursework, and real projects; current certifications include PMP, CompTIA A+, ITIL 4 Foundation, AWS Cloud Practitioner, Microsoft 365 Fundamentals, and LPI Linux Essentials.
