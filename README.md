# Shaun Joseph Stewart 
### [Project Management Professional (PMP) | IT Specialist](http://www.linkedin.com/in/shaunjosephstewart)

Customer-first IT specialist and Project Management Professional with a service mindset that started at Apple, grew through coordinating creative work as a freelance associate producer and video editor, and now guides how I lead and deliver in IT. At Apple I learned patient, plain-language support and front-of-house training. As a producer and editor, I refined planning, handoffs, and stakeholder alignment under real deadlines. As an IT specialist, I combine that foundation with calm troubleshooting, clear status updates, and simple SOPs that make fixes stick. I keep learning through labs, coursework, and real projects, supported by current certifications (PMP, CompTIA, ITIL, AWS, Microsoft) and a near complete B.S. in Information Technology at Western Governors University.

Over the years, I have had the privilege of contributing to the visions and needs of HBO, Sotheby‚Äôs, Google, Universal Music Group, Cond√© Nast, Yoox Net-A-Porter Group, Paper Magazine, the Hamptons International Film Festival, and several remarkable artists.
